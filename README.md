Sales Data Analysis
Project Description

This project focuses on the analysis of fictional sales data, modeled after the popular Kaggle Superstore dataset. The goal is to demonstrate skills in data cleaning, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizing key sales trends and statistics.

The Python script simulates the data acquisition process, prepares the data, and then generates charts illustrating sales trends, revenue per region, and profit per product category.
Technologies

    Python 3.x

    pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

    matplotlib: For creating static data visualizations.

    seaborn: For creating aesthetically pleasing statistical visualizations.

    numpy: For numerical operations and data generation.

Data

The data used in this project is synthetic and generated by the sales_analysis.py script. Its structure is modeled after the "Superstore" dataset available on Kaggle, containing columns such as: Order Date, Ship Date, Region, Category, Sub-Category, Sales, Profit, Quantity, Customer ID, Product ID.

The script intentionally introduces some missing values and errors in the data to demonstrate the data cleaning process.
File Structure

    sales_analysis.py: The main Python script for data generation, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

    superstore_sales.csv: A CSV file containing the generated (synthetic) sales data. This file is automatically created by sales_analysis.py on first run if it does not exist.

    README.md: This file, containing the project description and instructions.

How to Run the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

    Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x).

    Install the required libraries, if you don't have them already:

    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy

    Run the analysis script:

        Open your terminal or command prompt.

        Navigate to the directory where you saved sales_analysis.py.

        Execute the script using:

        python sales_analysis.py

        On the first run, the script will generate the superstore_sales.csv file. It will then load the data, perform the analysis, and display the plots in separate windows.

Key Analyses and Visualizations

The sales_analysis.py script performs the following main analyses and visualizations:

    Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, converting data types (e.g., dates, numerical values), and removing duplicates.

    Total Sales and Profit: Calculation of summary values.

    Sales and Profit per Region: Aggregating data to understand sales performance across different regions.

    Most Profitable Categories: Identifying which product categories generate the most profit.

    Sales Trends over Time: Analyzing monthly revenues to identify patterns and seasonality.

    Visualizations:

        Monthly Sales Trends: A line chart showing changes in revenue over time.

        Sales per Region: A bar chart comparing sales from different regions.

        Profit per Product Category: A bar chart presenting the profit generated by different product categories.
